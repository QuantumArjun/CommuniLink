Redwood Inc's HackGT project.
Online Platform to increase money accountability. It does this by creating a platform where users (ideally those who have donated/contributed to a certain project) can vote on how money is allocated towards a project.

Say for example, you have a charity holding a donation drive. After the drive is over, whoever donated money would receive an email link to our platform. Then, they could see how much money was raised (or how much money the charity would like to be publicly allocated), and then use a reddit-like voting system to provide input on how the money is spent.

The goal for this project is to increase accountability in terms of how money is spent and to increase engagement from the user side as a person is more likely to contribute to a cause if it feels like they're actively involved in the decision making process.
